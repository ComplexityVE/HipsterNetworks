#### Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?
The experiment is investigating how viruses spread throughout different network topologies and what the survival rate for viruses is. They want to see how the method proposed by the authors of the paper holds up on different network topologies. The explanation is clear. They have questions, an explanation on how they extend the model, and the main take aways in the abstract so it's easy to understand what their claiming.

#### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?
Methodology is clear, variables are explained. 

#### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?
Figure naming is not clear. "We show the results of our simulation in Figure 1.2 and Figure 2.2 in comparison to the original plots [1] in Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2 respectively." They mention Figure 1.2 twice but never 2.1, so it is confusing. 

Captions and axes are present. Caption explains what each graph is.

#### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?
There is very little interpretation for the experiment. It would be nice to have some explanation of what the results mean for both the replication and the extension. There shouldn't be a need to read the original paper to interpret the results. 

#### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?
Figures 2.1 and 2.2 look the same qualitatively but they are not quantitatively similar. They write that they were replicating it qualitatively, but they only write this: "to replicate Figure 2.1 up to 50 time steps as shown in Figure 2.2." as an interpretation of the results. It would be good to have some explanation as to why they are not quantitatively similar. I understand that it was run for 50 times steps, but as a reader I would expect to see the first half of the paper's graph rather than different numbers entirely.

#### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

#### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

#### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

#### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?
