# Draft Review of Simulation of Epidemic Spreading in Various Network Topologies

### Vicky McDermott

## Question:
### What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?
The experiment this team is replicating investigated the survival probability of viruses over a range of time. It answers the question of how prevalent epidemic spreading is in various network topologies. It also answers the question of what the survival probability of these viruses is over time for various spreading rates.

## Methodology:
### Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?
The methodology does seem to make to make sense for the question they are answering. They did a good job of describing the susceptible-infected-susceptible model that they used for their experiment. I would like to hear a little more about what the steady state prevalence for a disease is defined as. Does this mean that the same number of people are getting healthy and getting sick? Or something different?

## Results:
### Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?
The results seem to make sense and the replication of the graph plotting 1/spreading rate by the disease prevalence at steady state seems to be consistent with the graph they are replicating. Although I understand they only did 50 time steps for the graph of surviving probability over time, whereas the graph they are replicating has 100 time steps, I would like to see some more explanation of the quantitative differences between their graph and the original graph. The surviving probability in the original graph does not go below 10^-3 in the first 50 time steps but 3 out of 4 of their lambda values do go below 10^-3 in the replicated graph in the first 50 time steps.

## Interpretation:
### Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?
It seems as if the draft report has not really started interpreting the results yet. They have presented the results of their replication and are in the process of generating more results for their extension.

## Replication:
### Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the

## Extension:
### Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

## Progress:
### Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?
The progress of the team seems very reasonable to me. They still need to complete their replication but it certainly sounds like they both have a plan and have made a substantial start in implementing their extension. The replication seems to be very nearly done. I would still like to see a little more description and explanation of the discrepancies between their model and the one they are replicating but I think they have made very decent progress and are at a good place for this point in the project. 

## Presentation:
### Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

## Mechanics:
### Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?
Looks like it is located in the proper reports folder. The Markdown formatting looks good to me. The title does a good job of sparking interest and introducing the topic material and the full names of the authors are included in the paper. The bibliography looks to me to be in an acceptable style.
