# Analysis of the spread of hipster products throughout a network
#### Vicky McDermott and Emily Lepert
We are interested in investigating the spread of products throughout a network. Specifically how “hipsters” and “conformists” affect this spread. We will be mainly recreating the experiments run in the “Hipsters on Networks” paper. We plan on using Python and NetworkX to run our experiments.

We plan on recreating the initial experiment of the hipsters on networks paper. They analyzed how a hipster product spreads throughout a network by having “hipster” nodes and “conformist” nodes. The hipster nodes take on the unpopular product of the network while the conformist nodes take on the product that the majority of their neighbors adopt. To extend this model we will analyze how the degree of the starting node of the unpopular product affects the time it takes for that product to spread throughout the majority of the network. We can also see how the designation of the starting node (hipster vs. conformist) affects the spread of the product. We also plan on analyzing how having more than 2 products in the network affects the spread of those products. A larger extension would involve identifying which nodes are the most influential by analyzing the efficiency of the network when a node is removed.

Here are some examples of graphs that would be generated by our model:

* Graph that shows the degree of the starting node versus the time it takes for an idea to spread. *

* Graph showing adoption of an unpopular product over time when the first node considered is a hipster node versus when the first node is not a hipster node. *


If the adoption fraction for the two products is approximately equal between two runs of our model - one where the initial node is a hipster and one where the initial node is not, then we will know that choosing a hipster first does not affect the adoption fractions. We will also compare these graphs knowing that one has a larger degree on its initial node and see how this level of degree can affect the adoption fractions. We will also introduce a scale of hipster levels and see if having "hipsters" with opinions that are not as strong means that the adoption fractions of hipster products are smaller. Lastly, we will introduce a third product and see if the adoption fractions are still approximately equivalent even with two conformist products at the beginning.

We might encounter problems by not having enough data to plug into our model to validate it. This will require more research on what kinds of data are out there. Another cause for concern is not understanding some of the more complicated math that was used in the original hipster model. 

The first week will consist in recreating the experiment in the paper while the second week will be designing and implementing the extensions. We will start by pair programming the initial experiment and break off tasks as extensions come along.

[Hipsters on Networks: How a Small Group of Individuals Can Lead to an Anti-Establishment Majority](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07187.pdf),
*Jonas S. Juul, Mason A. Porter*; July 25, 2017.

The authors analyzed the impact of non conformists on two competing products by using a hipster threshold model and examining it in different types of networks including a Erdos-Renyi network. They were looking into how ideas that originated in a small subpopulation can spread to a large fraction of the nodes in a network. In this theoretical system there are multiple competing products and anti conformists spreading unusual products to the majority. After developing this model, the authors mathematically analyzed the conclusions and simulated the model on various synthetic networks. This model is interesting because it shows how anti establishment forces can gain power in politics and society. It also shows how unexpected parties, like Donald Trump in the most recent U.S. presidential election, might win elections and take office. There was not much validation of the model given in this paper, but it did draw some interesting conclusions. The results of the experiment show that even with a small number of non conformists, the products that originate with the non conformists or "hipsters" can become comparably or even more popular than other products. This led the authors to conclude that the anti establishment can in fact have a very large impact on the majority in a network. 

[How the science of complex networks can help developing strategies against terrorism](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077903004296)
*Latora, Marchiori*, Chaos, Solitons & Fractals(April 2004) 69-75

This paper discusses how identifying the "critical components of a given communication-transportation network" could diminish the impact of terrorist attacks as well as disrupting the terrorist organization. The paper models the communication network as a graph. Each location is a node and the links are Internet channels between each location. They measure the importance of a node by measuring the drop in the network perfomance when they remove that node. Through analysis and simulation they predict the importance of each location to a terrorist network. They use the execution and aftermath of 9/11 to validate their model. 


[Joint estimation of preferential attachment and node fitness in growing complex networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep32558.pdf),
*Thong Pham, Paul Sheridan, & Hidetoshi Shimodaira*; September 7, 2016.

This paper discusses the interplay of node fitness or the qualitative features of nodes which make them more likely to gain neighbors with preferential attachment or the idea that nodes which have lots of neighbors will gain neighbors at a rate faster than those that have fewer. Specifically, the authors discuss how preferential attachment and node fitness interplay in a Facebook wall-post network. They make use of a PAFit model and a Barabasi and Albert model. The purpose of the paper is to explain the coexistence of node fitness and preferential attachment and discuss how node fitness actually dominates preferential attachment. The authors analyze the model and compare it to a real world network of data on Facebook user wall posts. The real world curves agree well with the theoretical curves produced by their model. The model and output graphs support the idea that node fitness dominates preferential attachment in complex networks.
